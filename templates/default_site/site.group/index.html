    <h1>We're Getting Married!</h1>

    <img src="/static/images/us.jpg" class="us" />

    <p>After almost 9 years we both knew enough was enough and it was time to tie the knot. As much as we love attending weddings we knew they weren't for us, so we've decided <strong>we're going to elope to New York</strong> and wed there!</p>

    <h2>Our Big Day</h2>

    <img src="/static/images/office.jpg" class="office" />

    <p>On <strong>February 5th 2014</strong> we'll share our vows and celebrate our first day as married couple taking in some of the sights and sounds of NY, whiles admiring the views from the "<a href="#">Top of the Rock</a>" at the Rockefeller Center.</p>

    <h2>Knees Up!</h2>

    <p>It wouldn't be a wedding without all our friends and family so we're inviting you to <a href="#">Ruddington Grange Golf club</a> on the evening of <strong>Saturday February 8th 2014</strong> to help up celebrate our new chapter together.</p>
