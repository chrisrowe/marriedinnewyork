    <h1>We're Getting Married!</h1>

    <p>After almost 9 years we both knew enough was enough and it was time to tie the knot! As much as we love traditional weddings we knew they weren't for us, so we've decided <strong>we're eloping to New York!</strong></p>

        After a lovely walk through the grounds of Wollaton park with <a href="http://chri.sr/PYfZ">Archie</a> we arrived at the back, overlooking the lake. After a quick dash into the woods (to retrieve a picnik) Chris reappeared, got down on one knee and popped the question. A short <em>"Yes"</em> later and we toasted the occation with a glass of bubbly and a bite to eat.

        Just over 4 months later and we'll touch down in Las Vegas for a brief 4 day stop in "The Gambling Capital of the World". We'll be checking out the strip and all its amazing casinos and we'll probably take in a show or two.
